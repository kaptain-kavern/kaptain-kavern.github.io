## Community projects

### >>Rimworld's Modders United (**[RiMµ](https://github.com/RimWorldMod)**) Community Website
>*A __community driven__ website talking about modding Rimworld*          
   > ??? The DaiRiMµ \| The Daily RiMµ ???

I can see it at as good way to unite the community even a bit more  by 

- Centralizing even more our documentations and our debates/opinions

- Transmit good practise, resources and PSA, share devlog ... 

- etc 

- And, *if there is a public/demand for that*, it can even become a **"real"** website talking about the modding news (modders interview ,associated twitter account that ping at mod release, mods review, what else). 
 
**The thing is I intend it to be open to any redactors. For that I want it to be _really easy_ to propose/add posts (directly from Github website and starting to write plain text)**

> #### Proof of concept exemple :
> - [Here](https://github.com/kaptain-kavern/kaptain-kavern.github.io/blob/master/pages/projects.markdown) is the "source code" for this page rendered in Github interface (**directly editable**)
> - Here is the ["raw version"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaptain-kavern/kaptain-kavern.github.io/master/pages/projects.markdown) (*what I have actually typed*)

**I will also need collaborator(_s_) because I'm more a coder guy than a public/writer one**

## Code - Dev Projects

### >>Mod Presentation Page template
>*A Webpage, directly build from; and which will be hosted in an already existing mod/project's github repo*

[This](https://kaptain-kavern.github.io/AsSimpleAsRack/) is what Github pages can create automatically (the text and picture are pulled out  directly from the `readme.md` file). So this project will be basically to create a "Rimworld Mod" specific **Jekyll**/**Github Pages** template - *More complex project but could have some ideas/inspirations - [JekyllNow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)*
