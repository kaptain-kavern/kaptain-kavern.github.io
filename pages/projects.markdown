## Community

### Rimworld's Modders United (**[RiMµ]**) Community Website -
>*A community made, managed and driven website talking about modding Rimworld - ??? The DaiRiMµ \| The Daily RiMµ ???*

I can see it at as good way to unite the community even a bit more (_never enough_ ;-) )  by 

- Centralizing even more our documentations and "voices"

- Transmit good practise, resources and PSA, share devlog ... 

- etc 

- And, *if there is a public for that*, it can even become a **"real"** website talking about the modding news (modders interview ,associated twitter account that ping at mod release, mods review, what else). 
 
**The thing is I intend it to be open to any redactor AND it will be _really easy_ to propose/add posts (directly from Github website and starting to write plain text)** \| *I will also need collaborator(**s**) because i'm more a coder guy than a public/writer one*

## Code - Dev

### Mod/Project Presentation Page template
>*A Webpage, directly build from; and which will be hosted in an already existing mod/project's github repo*
