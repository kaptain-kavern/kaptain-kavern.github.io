## Community

### Rimworld Modder's United Community Website
>*A community made, managed and driven website talking about modding Rimworld*

I can see it at as good way to unite the community even a bit more (_never enough_ :wink: )  by 

- Centralizing even more our documentations and "voices"

- Transmit good practise, resources and PSA, share devlog ... 

- etc 

- And, *if there is a public for that*, it can even become a **"real"** website talking about the modding news (modders interview ,associated twitter account that ping at mod release, mods review, what else). 
 
**The thing is I intend it to be open to any redactor AND it will be _really easy_ to propose/add posts** \| *I will also need collaborators because i'm more a coder guy than a public/writer one*

## Code - Dev

### Mod/Project Presentation Page template
>*A Webpage, directly build from; and which will be hosted in an already existing mod/project's github repo*
